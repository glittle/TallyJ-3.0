        <li>When using TallyJ, the list of adults in the community who are eligible to vote,
            or be voted for, can be loaded using this page.</li>
        <li>To load the list of names, you must first prepare a comma-separated value (CSV file)
            with all the people's names in it.<ul>
                <li>The first line of the file must be a "headers row" with the names of each column. The headers should not include any accented words, such Bah&aacute;'&iacute;...</li>
                <li>The file should be saved as a normal Windows text/CSV file, or using UTF-8 or UTF-16
                    encoding.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This file must only contain the names of eligible adults. If it includes children
            and youth, or people no longer in the community or not eligible to vote, you should
            fix the CSV file before uploading it.
            <ul>
                <li>If the file is exported from a database or other tool, see if you can export it
                    again, with only the eligible adults included.</li>
                <li>You can also open the CSV file with a spreadsheet program, like Microsoft Excel,
                    and edit it there.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Once the CSV is ready to upload and process, proceed to Step 1 below to upload the
            file.</li>
        <li>In TallyJ, each person has a First and Last name. They also have other optional
            fields for more information, such as a maiden name or nickname. These fields are
            listed below. For each of the columns from the CSV file, select which TallyJ field
            it should be put into, if any. </li>
        <li>If you find that accented characters are not being processed correctly, you may
            need to change the Content Encoding and try Importing again. </li>

    Step 2: Map columns</h2>
<p>
  The columns in <span id="activeFileName"></span> must be mapped. If you have already done that, it does not need to be done again. 
  If you do need to determine the mapping, the columns found in the file are shown here, with the content from the few lines.
    For each column to include, identify the TallyJ field it is mapped to.

<h2>
    Step 3: Import people</h2>
<p>All the records in the file will be processed and added to the names already in the database. Any that match exactly will not be added again.
If you need to erase all the currently loaded names before ballots are entered, use the "Delete all People Records" below before importing again.</p>
