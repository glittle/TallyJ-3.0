    <h3>Some Guidance for Tellers in Bahá'í elections:</h3>

      <p>Invalid Ballots</p>
      <p>Under certain conditions an entire ballot may be declared invalid. These are:</p>
      <blockquote>
        (1) More than nine names on ballot paper;
                <br>
        (2) Less than nine names on ballot paper;
                <br>
        (3) Duplication of names.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Under other conditions, because of specified irregularities, one or more of the
        names may be invalidated but the rest of the ballot would be considered valid. These
        irregularities are:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        (1) A name not identifiable, or illegible;
                <br>
        (2) The name of an ineligible person, such as a youth or person not resident in
        the jurisdiction of the voting area, provided of course that each ballot contains
        no more or less than nine names and no name has been duplicated.
      </blockquote>

        The National Spiritual Assembly has received your email of ... inquiring what to do in a case where a ballot
        contains a duplicate name that is also a spoiled vote.  As the first step in the
        ballot-counting process is to verify the validity of each ballot, in the scenario you have described,
        the ballot would be considered as spoiled, and it would not reach the next stage of confirming
        the validity of each vote. <em>(NSA Canada, Email #S46363, 9 March 2012)</em>

        68. Each Voter Must Vote for the Nine Best Suited for Election -- Not Betray
            Sacred Trust
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a basic principle of elections for Bahá'í Spiritual Assemblies that
        each voter must vote for the nine people who, in his or her opinion, are best suited
        to serve. He may have a low opinion of all those who are eligible, but his duty
        is to vote for those nine from among them who, in his estimation, best meet the
        standards for service on a Spiritual Assembly. This is how it is possible to vote
        for exactly nine names. Since the membership of an Assembly is nine, it would give
        rise to a number of statistical anomalies if voters were permitted to record votes
        for fewer or more than nine names. In any one election there are not usually any
        cases where a voter accidentally makes a mistake and includes a name of an ineligible
        person, so the statistical effect is slight, and there is no need to invalidate
        his whole ballot. As you point out, a believer who does not wish to vote for nine,
        may achieve his end by purposely including the names of those who are ineligible,
        but this would be a betrayal of the trust placed in him as a Bahá'í voter. One cannot
        control such actions, but like any action contrary to the spirit of the Faith, they
        are detrimental and should be strongly discouraged. <em>(Compilations, Lights
        of Guidance, p. 21)</em>

        85. Results Reported to National Assembly for acceptance and Instructions to
              Tellers about Re-voting
      </p>
      <p>
        In answer to your question about who should decide this matter, the House
        of Justice states that it is the duty of the tellers to report the entire result
        of the voting, to the National Spiritual Assembly which has a duty of accepting
        the tellers' report before it is presented to the Convention. If the National Assembly
        sees that the ninth place is tied and that one of the persons tied is a member of
        a minority, it would instruct the tellers to report the results on this basis without
        calling for a re-vote. If, however, there is any doubt at all as to whether a minority
        is involved, the Assembly should resolve the matter by instruction that a re-vote
        for the ninth place should be held. <em>(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p.
        25)</em>

        Tellers
      </p>
      <p>
        The tellers are appointed by the outgoing Spiritual Assembly. Any Bahá'í, adult
        or youth, in good standing may serve as teller; however, the Chief Teller should
        be an adult. The task includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting the ballots</li>
        <li>Counting the ballots</li>
        <li>Making certain that the ballots are valid</li>
        <li>Recording the results</li>
        <li>Reporting the results to the election meeting</li>
        <li>Submitting to the local and National Spiritual Assembly a report signed by all
            tellers. This report becomes part of the permanent records of the community.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, the Chief Teller is responsible for organizing the work of the tellers, 
        announcing the results of the election and any other relevant information desired by the electors, 
        and ensuring that the election report is signed by all tellers.

        The National Spiritual Assembly has received your email of ... regarding tie-breaking votes 
        in elections.  You are correct in your understanding that there is only a need to break a tie in 
        Local Spiritual Assembly elections in cases where the membership of the Assembly is not determined.  
        As you have indicated, in unit elections, a tie-breaking vote should take place if the assigned 
        number of delegates is not determined on the first ballot, as well as when there is a tie between 
        any of the three believers receiving the next highest number of votes after the delegate(s).  
        It is necessary to determine the order of these three believers so that, should a delegate move out 
        of the unit prior to the National Convention, the National Assembly is able to recognize the believer 
        receiving the next highest number of votes as the delegate instead.
