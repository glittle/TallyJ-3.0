**TallyJ** facilitates the running of an election by tellers and allows voters to cast their ballot online.

It is targeted at communities of up to 50,000 members and is based on the guidelines
for holding elections as defined by the international Bahá'í community.

An election has two phases for tellers - collecting ballots and tallying
ballots. TallyJ helps with both.

When **collecting** ballots, all voters are registered and ballots are accepted.
Optionally, a roll call screen can be displayed.

Version 3 now adds the ability for **individual voters** to log into the website and
cast their ballot in any election they are a part of.

When **tallying** ballots, all names on the ballots are typed
into one or more computers by tellers, and on-screen reports provide instant results.

Can be accessed for free on the web (https://tallyj.com), or installed locally with IIS and SQL.
